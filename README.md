# Discord.js Lavalink Music Bot using erela.js

[Erela.js docs](https://solaris.codes/projects/erelajs) **Note this Discord Bot Repository is the Same as for the Public Bot [Lava Music](https://lava.milrato.eu) if u want to support me, then please [invite](https://lava.milrato.eu) him!**

## Installation | How to use the Bot

 **1.** Install [node.js v12+](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_unhandled_rejections_mode) or higher

 **2.** Download this repo and unzip it    |    or git clone it

 **3.** Install all of the packages with **`npm install`**     |  the important packages are   **`npm install discord.js erela.js`**

 **4** Fill in the parameters, RIGHT in `botconfig/config.json`!

 **5.** [Download Lavalink](https://ci.fredboat.com/viewLog.html?buildId=lastSuccessful&buildTypeId=Lavalink_Build&tab=artifacts&guest=1) and download Java 15 (Java 13 recommended)

 **5.1** Run the Lavalink file with: **`java -jar Lavalink.jar`**

 **MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS THE `application.yml` FILE OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT WORK!

 **6.** start the bot with **`node index.js`**

#### **NOTE:**

*If you are having errors/problems with starting delete the package.json file and do, before you install the packages `npm init`*
